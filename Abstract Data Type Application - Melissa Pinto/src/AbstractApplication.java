//Abstract Data Type Application

//Description: The Abstract data type application is a tool that helps arrange data a user 
//enters using three different abstract data types (List, Stack, Queue). The user inputs the 
//number of elements they want to enter, then inputs the elements in the text fields. Then they 
//can choose which data type they want to use. The program will ask the user which arrangement 
//they want to use. Finally the program outputs the new arrangement of elements.


//Features:
// take in users elements and sort them into a list, stack, or queue
// List arrangements
// Stack arrangements
// Queue arrangements 


//Major Skills:
// Creating an array from inputed data
// Changing an array into a an array list
// Changing an arraylist into a stack
// Changing an array into a queue
// button, label, text feild, text area, option pane, panel setups

//Areas of Concern: fitting many outputed elements into the label
